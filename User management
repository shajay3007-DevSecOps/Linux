User managment:
adduser: it is a Interactive and user friendly. Best when we use to create user manually
It will ask:
Full name
==> Password
==> Phone
==> Room number

useradd:  it is a Non-Interactive and Non-user friendly. Best when we use to create user with script.
==> No manual input
==> Suitable for automation and CI/CD processes

# sudo adduser user1
# sudo useradd user2
# sudo cat /etc/passwd
# su - user1
# su - uder2
# deluser user1

Add user to Groups:
# sudo addgroup g1
# sudo usermod -aG g1 user1
# groups
# sudo passwd -e user1 ==> first login password reset.
# sudo usermod -aG g1 user1
by defult it will create group for every user creation.
-a ==> is for append
-G ==> is for Group
-g ==> used for changing primary group.  == but it is not a best practice.
# sudo gpasswd -d user1 g1 ==> remove user from group.
